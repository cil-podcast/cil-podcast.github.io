    <h1>Conceived In Liberty</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Conceived In Liberty, a podcast where three friends run an imaginary dictatorship in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. If you're reading this, you're one of our citizens!</p>
    <p>This website is pretty bare-bones for now – I made it mainly so I could host audio and an RSS feed using Github. The fact that someone took the time to come here is pretty incredible!</p>
    <p>I'm sure we'll make a Patreon at some point, but we're not in this for the money. The best way you can support this podcast is by getting a friend to listen, but there's something even
      better you can do: The stuff we will likely do in this podcast to keep our populus in economic servitude is stuff that real dictators do. If our jokes and jiggles (?) and japery can make
      you a more aware citizen, then that would make us feel warm and fuzzy inside.</p>
    <p>Peace out, citizen!</p>
