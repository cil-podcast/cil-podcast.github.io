      <description>
          Three friends finally act on their idea to start a podcast.

          Talking points include: who we are, COVID-19, Paris Hilton, the biggest goldfish,
          state-controlled media in Hungary, Bloomberg's coverage of Bloomberg's campaign,
          twisting the good word of the U.S. Constitution, Casey's cat's bedtime,
          baking a nation from scratch.
